Given the hype around AI Copilots and startups forking VS Code to add their AI Copilots and Agents, I thought it would be interesting to look at the some revenue data for code editors and AI Copilots.

### Estimated revenue per November 2024

```
JetBrains:              $593M
GitHub Copilot:         $400M
Cursor:                 $65M
Codeium:                $10M
Bolt:                   $6M
VS Code:                $0
Sublime Text:           ?
Zed:                    ?
