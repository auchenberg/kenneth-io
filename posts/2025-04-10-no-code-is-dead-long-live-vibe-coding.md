It’s 2025, and it’s time to call it: No-code is dead.

The last decade of no- and low-code abstractions promised a revolution — they would democratize software creation. But let’s be honest: none of them broke through. No-code didn’t replace code or traditional programming. It didn’t even come close.

Now, a decade later, we’re watching something else emerge: **vibe coding** — a new breed of tools powered by AI and LLMs that can write real, production-grade code from natural language. Tools like [Bolt](https://bolt.new/), [Lovable](http://lovable.dev/), [v0](https://v0.dev/), and others are showing that prompt-to-code workflows are not only possible — they’re better.

Natural language is proving to be a more powerful interface than drag-and-drop WYSIWYG editors. And most importantly, people don’t want to be locked into proprietary runtimes. They want actual code. They want control. They want to scaffold, edit, and deploy anywhere.

It turns out people didn’t want _less code_ — they wanted a **better way** to write code.

The previous generation of platforms like Webflow and Retool tried to do it all: editor, hosting, runtime, components — bundled and closed. But now? Turns out LLMs can generate clean, idiomatic React, write to open standards, leverage industry best practices, and deploy to open infrastructure.

This is the **unbundling** of no-code.
