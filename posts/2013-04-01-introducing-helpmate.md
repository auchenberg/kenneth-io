A few months back I was sitting in [Jacob Bøtter](http://heutedenkenmorgenfertig.com/)'s kitchen discusing what it would take to disrupt postal services and ultimately eradicate letters for good.

After a few beers we came up with something different. I recently moved to a [new place](http://instagram.com/p/PjHbHADJCc/) here in Copenhagen, and been busy [renovating the apartment](http://instagram.com/p/PqnPkNDJMx/). Jacob still has 20-30 things in his apartment that needed to be fixed, but he hadn’t had time to tell people to do it.

So how about an iPhone app, where you just could snap a picture of what's needed to be done and it would be done?

We sketched out the concept, and created a little website with an introduction video. We are starting out in Copenhagen, and if enough people signup, we will make it happen.

We call the it [Helpmate](http://helpmate.dk/) (in danish).
