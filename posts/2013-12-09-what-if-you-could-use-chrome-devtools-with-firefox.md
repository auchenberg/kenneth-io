To many front-end developers this is a ubiquitous dream, but is it really?

About a month ago I launched an idea I’ve had for a while. The idea is called [RemoteDebug](http://remotedebug.org), and is an initiative to unify remote debugging across browsers. As a part of my presentation at [FullFrontal conference](http://2013.full-frontal.org/#our-web-development-workflow-is-completely-broken) where I talked about RemoteDebug, I demoed an early prototype of using Chrome DevTools together with Mozilla Firefox.

I want to tell you a bit more about the prototype.

For the demo I didn't invented something completely new. Instead I’ve written something I call a “RemoteDebug bridge”, that acts as a translator between the different dialects of remote debugging protocols.

My vision is to provide a bridge for each remote debugging protocol, but for my demo I’ve written a bridge called [remotedebug-firefox-bridge](https://github.com/auchenberg/remotedebug-firefox-bridge). As the name indicates, it's a simple translator between [Google Chrome Remote Debugging](https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/debugger-protocol) and [Mozilla Firefox Remote Debugging](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Remote_Debugging_Protocol).

The bridge is implemented as a small node app that connects to Firefox by using Firefox's existing remote debugging protocol, translates the commands and provides a Chrome Remote Debugging compliant HTTP and WebSocket endpoints, which Chrome DevTools is then configured to connect to.

It make it more understandable I created a small screencast showing it in action:

It's still an early prototype, but [remotedebug-firefox-bridge](https://github.com/auchenberg/remotedebug-firefox-bridge) shows some of the possibilities that will be possible when we, as a community, unify remote debugging in our browsers.

If you think this is a good idea, you should read more about the [RemoteDebug](http://remotedebug.org) initiative. Help me pass the message along to our browser vendors.

This is just the beginning. Imagine where we can go from here.
