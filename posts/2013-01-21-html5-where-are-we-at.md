Last week I spoke at a [Warm Crocodile Conference](http://warmcrocconf.net/), a new by [Microsoft](http://microsoft.com) in Copenhagen, and later the same evening at our [CopenhagenJS meetup in Malmo](http://lanyrd.com/2013/copenhagenjs-january/), hosted by [FooCafe](http://foocafe.org/).

My talk was about how far we are with our web platform - more specifically HTML5. I wanted to give a different talk then the usual "HTML5 buzz talk" that mostly has been about the fancy new features and possibilities we got with HTML5.

## HTML5 in perspective.
In my talk I talked about the evolution we have been though the past years, how the evolution has been driven by [WHATWG](http://www.whatwg.org/), and [W3C](http://www.w3c.org/), and how we sometimes has ended up with weird evolution (as Christian Heilmann pointed out in [his brilliant talk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7ahspCqFMs)).

I gave an overview of the current browser landscape, how auto-updating has been introduced to the platform, and few examples on how far we are with actual browser support to highlight the shocking truth: We haven't gotten that far the past many years, mainly because older browsers are holding us back.

## IE8 is pollution
More specificly it's older versions of Internet Explorer, especially IE8, the last upgrade-path for Windows XP users. In my talk I had the statement that IE8 is pollution, that holds us back from moving the platform forward. This thought was put in my head by [Alex Russel](http://infrequently.org/), at last years [Fronteers](http://fronteers.nl/) (2012) in Amsterdam, and has slowly grown on me.

In addition I breifly touch the today's browser tooling, and the lack of innovation in it, by showing how little we have innovated since the good days of IE5.5.

Lastly I covered the work that has been going on in the [W3C Core Mobile Community Group](http://coremob.org/), how it relates to [Facebook](http://facebook.com), and what it means for the future.

## Version2 coverage
My IE8 statement was picked up by one of the biggest IT media's in Denmark, version2, who has written a [wonderful article](http://www.version2.dk/artikel/frontendudvikler-internet-explorer-8-forurening-html5-49943#comment-226337), with an even more brilliant photo of me (very ironic). I hope articles like this can fuel the debate, so we, front-end developers, will unite and do something about IE8.


Many of the subjects in this talk deserves a seperate blog posts, so instead of going into more detail, I've embedded the slides (yup, regular iframe), so go check them out, or find them here <a href="http://auchenberg.github.com/presentations/warmcroc-html5-where-are-we-at/">HTML5 - Where are we at?</a>
