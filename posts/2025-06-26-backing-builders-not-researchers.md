We're in the middle of an accelerating AI cycle, where the dominant investment thesis has been: find PhDs spinning out of Stanford, MIT, or CMU, write them $50M checks, or [$100M sign-on bonuses](https://www.reuters.com/business/sam-altman-says-meta-offered-100-million-bonuses-openai-employees-2025-06-18/), and hope their transformer research turns into the next Google.

I take a different view: **most researchers don't make great entrepreneurs.** Breakout companies are rarely built by brilliant academics working in isolation. They're built by well-rounded operators — people with deep technical skills, strong product sense, and the ability to hire a great team that can build products customers actually want to pay for.

The current AI investment model resembles the old semiconductor playbook: back the scientist with the breakthrough and figure out commercialization later. In semiconductors, that worked — physics breakthroughs translated directly into durable moats through massive capital requirements and specialized manufacturing.

That's mostly been true in AI so far. Research-driven investments into foundation models have paid off — but the moat is shrinking. Open source is catching up fast, and "good enough" is already here for many mainstream use cases.

I'm not saying research labs don't matter — they absolutely do, and we're all thankful for the foundational work they enable. But as most early tech companies didn't work on transistors, they **accrued value** from them. The same will happen in the age of AI, where most of the long-term value will come from **leveraging AI,** not building technology in search of a customer.

The next AI investment thesis is closer to traditional software investing, and the founders worth backing are [AI-native founders](https://kenneth.io/post/ai-native-founders-and-the-new-reality-for-early-stage-investing) — operators who treat GPT, Claude, or even AGI like AWS or Stripe: powerful infrastructure that lets them focus on the hard part of solving real problems for customers.

The next Salesforce or Facebook won't be a foundation model — it'll sure be built on top of one.

**The future belongs to builders who ship, not researchers who publish.**
