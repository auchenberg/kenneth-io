As someone who started as an angel investor and now works as a full-time investor, I've seen both sides of the early-stage funding equation. There's a fundamental difference between venture scouting and traditional angel investing that founders need to understand before they take money.

Angel investing used to mean putting your own capital at risk. You wrote a check from your personal account because you believed in a founder before everyone else. The signal was clear — credibility, network, and hard-earned money backing a bet.

That credibility had weight because it cost something.

Now, scout funds typically run by mega-funds have changed the equation. A scout gets $200K–$250K annually to deploy. They write you a $20K check and call themselves an angel investor. But the money isn't theirs.

For the fund, scout programs serve as lead generation operations. Partners get access and information rights into early-stage companies, allowing them to track promising startups and potentially invest at later rounds with better information than competitors.

## The incentive problem

What's in it for the scout? Free capital, big-name fund brand, and zero personal risk.

The result: scouts typically deploy into high-risk bets with house money, then double down with personal capital only when conviction is high. It's the rational thing to do when the downside isn't yours, so it means founders might get $50K of scout money and maybe $10K of the scout's personal capital.

That's the opposite of conviction. If the scout believed in you, they would have used their own money.

## What founders should look for

Ask every angel investor: How much of this check is your own money?

Incentives have to align. Real angel investors still exist — people writing personal checks with real conviction. They show up because their success depends on yours.

Scout money isn't inherently bad. But know what you're getting: fund access with no follow-on guarantees, limited engagement, and a cap table entry that signals less than you think.

The bar is simple. Skin in the game. Everything else is noise.
