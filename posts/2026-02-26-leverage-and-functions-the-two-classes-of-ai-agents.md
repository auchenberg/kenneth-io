Lately, I've started to think about AI agents through a reductionist framework of two fundamentally different buckets: **Leverage** and **Functions**. The distinction matters more than most people realize, because it changes everything downstream — how you build the product, how you sell it, and what kind of business you're actually creating.

## Leverage agents

The first class of agents give humans orders of magnitude more leverage. Think of them as infinite Chiefs of Staff. They don't replace you — they amplify you. They draft, research, coordinate, summarize, and execute on your behalf, but the human stays in the loop, making the calls.

One person with the right leverage agent will feel like a team of fifty.

## Function agents

The second class of agents replace entire job functions end-to-end. They don't augment a person. They _are_ the person. Think autonomous customer support, bookkeeping, or outbound sales. These agents own the workflow from start to finish, operating without a human in the loop.

## The downstream effects

This distinction changes how you build, sell, and price these products. Leverage agents are sold to the humans they empower. Function agents are sold to the organizations that no longer need to hire for those roles.

Both are coming fast. But they require very different go-to-market strategies, very different product designs, and ultimately, very different business models. Understanding which one you're building is the first question every AI agent startup should be asking.

There's also an interesting space between the two. Many of the best agent products will start as Leverage — augmenting a human, earning trust, learning the workflow — and over time transition into Functions, gradually taking over end-to-end as confidence and capability grow. That progression from copilot to autopilot might be the most natural path to full autonomy.

This framework is still very much a work in progress, but it's how I'm thinking about things right now. The more agent products I see, the more I find myself applying it. I'd love to pressure-test it — so challenge me. What did I miss?
