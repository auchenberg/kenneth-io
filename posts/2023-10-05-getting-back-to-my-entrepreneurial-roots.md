I recently wrapped up my time at [Stripe](https://stripe.com/), where I've the past four years building developer experience infrastructure in various forms, spanning everything from tooling, docs, and SDKs to application platforms & ecosystems.

Working at [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) has been an incredibly fulfilling journey. I've had the pleasure of working with some exceptionally talented individuals and operating at a scale – with rigor and attention to detail – that's hard to come by in our industry. It’s been a fantastic ride.

Stripe years are like dog years; they truly feel like a lifetime. So, a long summer break here in NYC has been much needed.

With summer coming to an end, it’s time to discuss what’s on the horizon.

Back in [2019](https://kenneth.io/post/joining-stripe), after working on [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) at Microsoft, I made a prediction that [Software 2.0](https://karpathy.medium.com/software-2-0-a64152b37c35) and the rise of low-code/no-code were indicators of an imminent paradigm shift that requires us to rethink the way we think about and write software. 

Since then, we have started to see the realized impact of the rise of [Software 3.0](https://medium.com/@itamar_f/software-3-0-the-era-of-intelligent-software-development-acd3cafe6cd7) and AI/LLM powered Developer Tools. However, it's still early days, and as I peek into the future, my foundational thesis is:

> We're transitioning from a world where 80% of all code is written by humans to a reality where the majority of code will be authored by LLMs/Agents. 

This transition will have profound second (and third) order effects on our developer tools and what I call [Developer Experience Infrastructure (DXI)](https://kenneth.io/post/developer-experience-infrastructure-dxi). We are on the cusp of one of the few fundamental paradigm/platform shifts in our industry, and this is something I want to be a part of.

Doubling down on this conviction, I'm returning to my entrepreneurial roots. I'll be dedicating more time to the early-stage DevTools landscape, working with and supporting DevTools founders in both fractional and advisory roles.

I'm also ramping up my angel investing via [developers.vc](https://developers.vc/) to fuel the next generation of developer tools.

And who knows? Maybe it’s time to build something. Time will tell.

If you're a founder, operator, or VC and believe I can assist you, or if there's potential for collaboration, please don’t hesitate to reach out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/auchenberg), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/auchenberg/), or [good old email](mailto:kenneth@auchenberg.dk).


I’d love to chat and collaborate!

Best,
Kenneth
