In our most recent release of our [Chrome debugger for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome), we have landed a bunch of improvements to our sourcemapping-engine, which enables us to support live-editing and debugging out of the box with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This enables you as a developer to write and debug your React code without leaving the editor, and most importantly it enables you to have a continuous development workflow, where context switching is minimal, as you donâ€™t have to switch between tools.

You can now write code, set a breakpoints, make a changes to the code, and debug your newly modified codeâ€Šâ€”â€Šall from your editor ðŸ”¥ *ðŸŽ‰*ðŸŽˆ

### How to get started in 6Â steps

1.  Download the [latest release of VS Code](http://code.visualstudio.com/Download) and install our [Chrome debugger](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome)
2.  Create your React app using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
3.  Use the following config for your `launch.json`file to configure the VS Code debugger and put it insideÂ `.vscode` in your root folder.
4.  Start your React app by running `npm start` in your favorite terminal
5.  Start debugging in VS Code by pressing `F5`or by clicking the green debug icon

Happy debugging! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽˆ

### Details

Our Chrome debugger now supports [Webpackâ€™s Hot Module Replacement mechanism](https://webpack.github.io/docs/hot-module-replacement.html), which pushes module changes to the browser by running a local file watcher.

Our debugger is now able to pickup these changes and re-applies the newly generated HMR sourcemap to the loaded source files on the fly. This enables the live editing and debugging experiences, _without adding a need for more file watches or background tools._
