Back in October last year, I spoke a Microsoft Campus Days 2012. A relatively small Microsoft conference in Copenhagen focused on IT professionals and developers.

I did a reality check of HTML5. How far we have gotten, and what problems we are facing with our web platform. I started out by asking how many people that were developers, and 99% of the attendes was developers.

<!--more-->

A good thing, but this was my first presentation without any code, so it was a bit up the hill for a crowd that expected code examples. I think the Microsoft-guys understood my message.

The talk in danish, so if you understand my mother tongue, go ahead and watch my presentation (yes, sadly it's Silverlight);
