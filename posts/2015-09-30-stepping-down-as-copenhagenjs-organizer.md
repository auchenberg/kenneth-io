Back in December I [decided to quit my job](https://kenneth.io/blog/2014/12/12/leaving-citrix-time-for-a-break/) and take a leap into unexplored territories. I ended up [packing a backpack to travel Asia](https://kenneth.io/blog/2015/02/22/60-items-for-the-next-many-months-in-asia/), which has been an amazing experience, but it also meant that I haven’t been able to help organizing [CopenhagenJS](http://copenhagenjs.dk), as I simply haven’t been around.

Now I’m back in Copenhagen, and been putting a bit of thought into how I should be spending my time going forward, and I reached the conclusion that it’s time to step down as [CopenhagenJS](http://copenhagenjs.dk) organizer and pass the baton on.

## 4 years of fun years with CopenhagenJS

CopenhagenJS came to life in the summer of 2011, after I one afternoon randomly tweeted this:

	<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thinking about starting a new JavaScript group in Copenhagen, to bring some life to the community. &#10;&#10;Anyone up for joining <a href="https://twitter.com/copenhagenjs">@copenhagenjs</a>?</p>&mdash; Kenneth Auchenberg (@auchenberg) <a href="https://twitter.com/auchenberg/status/92983442437963776">July 18, 2011</a></blockquote>

I tweeted this without knowing much about the existing front-end/javascript community. Soon after [Bjorn](https://twitter.com/bjorn_js) asked if I was interested in taking over the existing Oresund JavaScript meetup group (which I never attended) and [Morgan Roderick](https://twitter.com/mrgnrdrck) also stepped in and bought the copenhagenjs.dk domain.

	<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

In a matter of just a few days we had managed to join forces, we merged the existing front-end meetups into CopenhagenJS, build a website, designed a logo, and on the [21 July 2011](http://copenhagenjs.dk/2011/07/21/hello-copenhagenjs/) we announced the first meetup, where the original Podio offices were literally stuffed with wonderful people.

With [CopenhagenJS](http://copenhagenjs.dk) I wanted to create a forum where we could discuss our problems, share ideas and most importantly get inspired. The name has been a bit off from the beginning, as my intention was to cover front-end in broad, and not just JavaScript, but we followed a trend, and got a logo (almost) for free. We have meet [consistently every third Thursday](http://copenhagenjs.dk/past/) every month for more than 4 years, and have managed to build a community around front-end and JavaScript from the ground up.

Over the years our community has grown, and we now have more than [1.100 followers](https://twitter.com/copenhagenjs), and many wonderful people joining the meetups. When [Bjorn](https://twitter.com/bjorn_js) stepped down as organizer, [Peter Müller](https://twitter.com/_munter_) stepped up, who for the past years, has been driving the community together with me.

Our community ins't the biggest community in the world, but we had a fantastic range of speakers. We have had international international names like [Douglas Crockford](http://copenhagenjs.dk/2013/11/06/crockford/) and [Seb Lee Delisle](http://copenhagenjs.dk/2014/05/02/creativejs-demodag-event/) stopping by. We have done special events with companies like [Adobe](http://copenhagenjs.dk/2012/09/26/october-busy-month/), [Microsoft](http://copenhagenjs.dk/2013/01/03/special-future-internet-explorer-event/) and [GitHub](http://copenhagenjs.dk/2013/05/13/github-training-workshop-event/), and we been hosted by many great companies, who I’m thankful for their investments into the local community.

## Meetup evolved into ColdFront Conference

Two [years ago](https://kenneth.io/blog/2014/04/09/introducing-coldfront-conference/) I started [ColdFront Conference](http://coldfrontconf.com), which was an idea that came up among us organizers, as we wanted to take the local community to an international level. I ended up being the one executing on the idea, and just a few weeks ago, we ran the [second ColdFront](http://2015.coldfrontconf.com), and the [feedback been incredible](https://storify.com/auchenberg/coldfront-conference-2015). But organizing a conference is an incredible time consuming thing, and combining it with a monthly meetup, is a bit too time consuming.

So now that I’m back in Copenhagen I’ve decided to take a step back, and look at all the many projects I’m involved with, and revise how my commitment should be.

## Going forward

This means I’m now stepping down as [CopenhagenJS](http://copenhagenjs.dk) organizer, and I passed the baton to the [Kevin Simper](http://twitter.com/kevinsimper) who is the main driver of community today. I’m sure Kevin’s drive and commitment to CopenhagenJS will take the community to new levels. To support Kevin and welcome a “new generation” of organizers, we are also looking for new co-organizers, so if you are interested reach out to Kevin.

Much has happened in Copenhagen the past 4 years. We now have an established tech & startup-scene with [CPHFTW](http://cphftw.org). We have a better meetup culture, and the rise of JavaScript has shown a need for a strong united community.

So going forward, I sincerely hope that new organizers and organizers of existing meetups like [cphfront](http://cphfront.com), will come together, collaborate, and maybe even unite. So we, together, can show the world why Copenhagen should be on the international front-end map.


Thanks for the ride.
